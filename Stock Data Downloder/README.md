# Stock Data Downloader

A simple Python script to download stock data from Yahoo Finance and save it as a CSV file. This project is designed for beginners who want to explore Python and stock market data.

## Background and Context

I developed this script as part of my journey to upskill from VBA and R, tools I had used extensively during my university days, to Python. It was fascinating to see the differences in script structure and logic between these languages. Python's versatility and simplicity have made it an excellent tool for tasks like data analysis and automation.

This script was particularly useful for creating Power BI dashboards. The CSV files generated by the script could be easily loaded into Power Query, where I could clean and transform the data as needed. Over time, as my Power BI skills advanced, I learned to load data directly into Power BI, but this script remains a handy tool for prototyping and quick data downloads.

I primarily run this script in VS Code, and it was developed around mid-2024. While I haven't tested it extensively on other terminals, it should work in any Python environment with the required dependencies installed.

## Features

- Download historical stock data for any ticker symbol widely available on Yahoo Finance.
- This script supports ticker symbols for Australian companies listed on the ASX (e.g., BHP.AX for BHP Group or CSL.AX for CSL Limited). Data is typically provided in AUD.
- Specify the start and end dates for the data range.
- Save the data to a CSV file for easy access.


## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following installed:

1. **Python** (Version 3.6 or later)
   - [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. **yfinance library**
   - Install the library using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install yfinance
     ```

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DashOfRisk/Python-Financial-Modelling.git
   cd stock-data-downloader
   ```

2. **Run the Script**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the script:
     ```bash
     python stock_data_downloader.py
     ```

3. **Provide Input**:
   - Enter the stock ticker symbol (e.g., `AAPL` for Apple, BHP.AX for BHP Group or CSL.AX for CSL Limited).
   - Enter the start date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g., `2024-01-01`).
   - Enter the end date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g., `2024-12-31`).

4. **Find the CSV File**:
   - The downloaded data will be saved in the same folder as the script with the name `<TICKER>_data.csv`.

## Error Handling

This script includes several layers of error handling:

1. **Ticker Symbol Validation**:
   - If the provided ticker symbol is invalid or the stock is delisted, the yfinance library may return an empty dataset. The script does not explicitly validate the ticker but will notify the user if the dataset is empty after download.

2. **Date Validation**:
   - Dates must be entered in the format YYYY-MM-DD. If an incorrect format is provided, the script may raise an error or unexpected behavior. Ensure valid input to avoid issues.

3. **File Save Location**:
   - The script saves the CSV file in the current working directory. If the working directory is not set correctly, you may find the file in an unexpected location. The script displays the current working directory after execution for clarity..

4. **Empty Datasets**:
   - If the yfinance library retrieves an empty dataset for the specified ticker and date range, the saved CSV file will also be empty. Ensure the input values are correct.
   
## Example

```bash
Welcome to the Stock Data Downloader!
Enter the stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL): AAPL
Enter the start date (YYYY-MM-DD): 2024-01-01
Enter the end date (YYYY-MM-DD): 2024-12-31
Downloading data for AAPL from 2024-01-01 to 2024-12-31...
Saving data to AAPL_data.csv...
Download complete!
```

After running the script, you will find a file named `AAPL_data.csv` in the project folder.

## About the Code

The script uses the `yfinance` library to fetch stock data and Python's built-in `input()` function for user interaction. It's designed to be simple and easy to understand for Python beginners.
